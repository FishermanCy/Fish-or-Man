# Fish-or-Man
Fish or man is a 2 player party game where two players (one fish and one fisherman) compete to survive longer than the other. Each player must jump over an onslaught of cannonballs in order to gain as high a score as possible and win more than their opponent. This application includes the code, graphics, sound effects, and more that you need in order to play this game. I used pygame as the framework and wrote all my code in Visual Studio Code. I wanted to add a high score system, but struggled with displaying it on the end screen so I moved on. I may add it eventually.
# Installation
To install the game, download the folder from this repository and open it in VS Code. Make sure that you have the "finalProjectGraphics" and "finalProjectAudio" files along with the "finalProject.py" file. Now if you run finalProject.py, a new window titled "Fish-or-Man" should appear. The game begins immediately, so be prepared to start playing.
# How to use
Fish-or-Man has incredibly simple controls. The W key makes the left character, the fisherman, jump (or "swim" to keep the theme). Same thing for the right character, the fish, except with the up-arrow key instead. The final player input is the spacebar, which is used to start the next round whenever the game enters the "game-over" state. If you want to end the game, just close the window (this will restart the tracking of each players wins, starting at 0 when you reopen the game).
# Credits
Just me! I made this for a school project on my own.
